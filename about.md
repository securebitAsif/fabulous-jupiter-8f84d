I am an Experienced IT Security-Expert and Cloud Solution enthusiast with profound knowledge in cryptography, applied security and legal security regulations.<br>

I approach projects by building and seeing the “big picture”, then going down layers and ask myself what could, can and will go wrong on each layer. Here is an insightshard of my most valuable project experiences, which shall give an impression of my individual contribution.
