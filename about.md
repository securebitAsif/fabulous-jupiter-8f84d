**I am an Experienced IT Security-Expert and Cloud Solution enthusiast** with profound knowledge in cryptography, applied security and legal security regulations.<br><br>
**My work is based on** proven and recognized methodologies. I approach projects by building and seeing the “big picture”, then going down layers and ask myself what *could, can and will go wrong* on each layer. Here is an insight of my most valuable project experiences, which shall give an impression of my individual contribution.

**My path of specialisation is** Electrical Engineering -> Information Technology -> Web technology -> Cloud Technology -> Big Data Security

**Currently I am working on** enterprise scale telecommunication project as a security by design consultant at Vodafone Group on behalf of Cloudyrion GmbH. This includes 
- Development pipeline hardenings
- Consulting in early development steps
- Threat modeling and risk analysis on the complete solution
- Penetration testing and report evaluation
- Data privacy and user access management report evaluation
- Final security reporting to management including mitigation plan

**Before Tech I worked** at Siemens in IT Operations and Infrastructure.

**My educational path is** shaped by my desire to break limits and find innovative solutions to shape a more comfortable life:

- After finishing my Abitur with focus on Math and Physics 
- I started studying Electrical Engineering at Ruhr-Uni Bochum (2015)
- Specialised in Computer Science at Uni Duisburg-Essen
- Continuing on achieving expert level by studying M.Sc. Applied IT Security at Ruhr-Uni Bochum
